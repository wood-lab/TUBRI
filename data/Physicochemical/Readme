### Below is a description of the data files available in the geospatial data folder.


## Physicaldata_USGS.xlsx

This data set includes a lot of physical parameters measured by USGS at the Pearl River near Bogalusa. The sampling station is located at latitude 30.7932614161365, longitude -89.8209117246503 (just north of highway 10). Parameters include water temperature, streamflow, suspended solids etc. DMDM deleted those columns which were totally empty. Measurements are available monthly from 1963-1995 but there are several gaps, especially for the months.

Title: Historical Conditions for the South Atlantic-Gulf Region
Description: The U.S. Drought Monitor (2000–present) depicts the location and intensity of drought across the country. Every Thursday, authors from NOAA, USDA, and the National Drought Mitigation Center produce a new map based on their assessments of the best available data and input from local observers. The map uses five categories: Abnormally Dry (D0), showing areas that may be going into or are coming out of drought, and four levels of drought (D1–D4). Drought results from an imbalance between water supply and water demand. The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) measures water supply, specifically precipitation. SPI captures how observed precipitation (rain, hail, snow) deviates from the climatological average over a given time period—in this case, over the 9 months leading up to the selected date. Red hues indicate drier conditions, while blue hues indicate wetter conditions. Data are available monthly from 1895–present.
