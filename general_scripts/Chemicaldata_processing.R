### Nutrients----
## Import data for nutrients

nutrients <- read_csv("data/Physicochemical/nutrients_resultphyschem.csv")

# Read USGS-gage site metadata

siteinfo <-  read_csv("data/Physicochemical/station_info.csv")

# Add info on sampling sites (latitude, longitude, CI, etc.)

nutrients_withmetadata <- merge(nutrients, siteinfo, by.x = "MonitoringLocationIdentifier", by.y = "MonitoringLocationIdentifier", all.x = TRUE)

# Summarize by taking the mean per year

# Nitrogen species: nitrogen available to plants occurs in the form of 
# ammonia (NH3), ammonium (NH4+), nitrate (NO3âˆ’), nitrite (NO2-), and 
# organic nitrogen. However, the data that we have most complete is that of inorganic N
# (nitrate and nitrite). Nitrate and nitrite have data for most years except between 1977-1984. 
# However, we have data for that window of time as "inorganic nitrogen (nitrat and nitrite).
# Therefore, we use that to fill the gap. 


# Take only nitrate, nitrite, and their sum (inorganic nitrogen (nitrate and nitrite))

# From the following plot you can see that nitrate and nitrite have the longest time span
# Inorganic nitrogen was measure in most recent years. So we will the gap in nitrate and nitrite with inorganic N.

### Phosphates did not change much over time so we keep it out to reduce dimensionality
